# Job Application Bot
This bot saves jobs by different types on Indeed and Glassdoor and exports them to a csv file. A job match scored is calculated by comparing a resume to the job description. It can also apply to job forms which are easily filled out, such as Lever and Greenhouse forms. Finally, there is a LinkedIn connections bot which automatically sends connection requests to people based on keywords supplied.
